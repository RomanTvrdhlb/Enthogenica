              </div>
              <p>To face what is, makes sense past shattered dreams and broken hopes but not before,
                as echoed in: “Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed
                until it is faced.” To turn toward rather than away from and to look into rather than for a
                way out of one’s given condition, makes for grace, grit and gratitude...
                <br><br>
                Personal as erotic desire, interpersonal as relationship and transpersonal as the
                sounded breath of speech, to negate the primal from the psychedelic or the precious
                from the present makes for pride, prejudice and possessiveness. Hence, in lieu of
                integrity, empathy, agency and virtuosity, there is ideology, energy, anxiety and vanity
                instead...
                <br><br>
                To face what is in the here and now over striving and seeking how shattered dreams
                and broken hopes can be remedied and fixed, caused enthogenica to come about that
                does the same as consciousness; the corpus, consonant and cosmos of phenomena...
                <br><br>
                The contrast that contrasts, consciousness cannot be had but only become aware of up
                close and intimate by facing the given condition of being human: to evolve out from the
                mirage of metaphorical unity...

              </div>
              <p>The root cause of evolution, the primal is as arousing as desire, consummating as the erotic and as
                interpersonal as relationship. The concomitant other of consciousness, the psychedelic is as
                immeasurable as infinity, intangible as awareness and as transpersonal as listening. The breath of any
                phenomenon, the precious is as empathic as com-passion, reflective as re-cognition and as personal as
                response-ability…
                <br><br>
                Not re-, pro-, nor co-creational but as genuine as vulnerability, evolution rather than
                power, profit and prestige drives becoming and being human. Interdependent rather
                than performance-centered, to be human does not come about in a vacuum but
                coexistence that links parts into wholes and wholes into organisms; from photon to
                plankton and molecule to metamorphism...
                <br><br>
                The grow out and up from the performance-centered phantasm of romance, religion and reason and into
                coexistence leads through the proverbial dark night of the soul; the deep and dreamless sleep state in
                waking consciousness. Faced with the dissolution of any and all attachment, life and death are but the
                identity rather than reality of memory, maternity and morality; me, my, mine, before anyone has moved
                across the battlegrounds of gene, gender and godhead...

              <p>To catalyze the embracement of and surrender to desire, <span class="main-bold">enthogenica</span>
                utilizes psychoactive compounds. To
                be given rather than taken, to make meaning of psychoactive compounds is just as illusionary as
                understanding. The infinite remnants of impermanence, psychoactive compounds bring the blended and
                blotted out to light. Thereby, desire is returned from exile up close and personal in the here and now.
                Taken on one’s own, psychoactive compounds merely perpetuate the imago dei of “I, me, mine,” because
                “only in relationship do you see the face of what is”...
                <br><br>
                Conducted in the comfort of one’s home or another suitable place of one’s choosing, Tetiana & Christoph
                ground and guide <span class="main-bold">enthogenica’s</span> non-dual sessions that last anywhere from
                six to a maximum of eight
                hours. The price per session is € 1200. An open mind and a vital body; no more or less is asked for
                engaging with enthogenica. In the preliminary online meeting, any other questions can be directly
                addressed. That said, be well rested and abstain from alcohol, meat and dairy on the day of the
                encounter. Dress in lounge clothes without wearing any perfume or scented oils...
                <br><br>
                Conducive to anyone who is called to face and acknowledge what is over going for ceremony or settling
                for complacency, falling for vanity or fishing for ecstasy, enthogenica’s non-dual encounters strike
                mostly a cord with the mature, genuine, vulnerable and humble. The same holds true for the embracement
                and surrender to desire...

              </div>
              <p>Born and raised in Switzerland with a work history as a psychologist in the US and China, which
                followed on the heels of a decade long engagement with Zen Buddhism and contemplative Sufism, Christoph
                relocated to the Netherlands from war-torn
                Ukraine where he alongside Tetiana had set up an entheogenic related retreat in the Carpathian
                Mountains...
                <br><br>
                Serendipitously introduced to Ayahuasca at age thirty, this prompted him to move to Ecuador two decades
                later to intensively engage himself with such psychoactive compounds. Enthogenica, his present endeavor,
                is equally informed by Robert Keagan
                and Susanne Cook-Greuter’s adult ego development stages as well as his surrender to what has yet to
                emerge by embracing the given condition of being human: coexistence rather than denial, disassociation
                and delusion...
                <br><br>
                As such, Christoph relates through listening rather than from cost and benefit; through letting the
                bygone be rather than from banking on tradition, technology and theosophy, and through reaching across
                rather than from clinging to one’s own presumptive and projected certitude and conjured up worldview...

              </div>
              <p>Courage and faith have led Tetiana, who is a native of Ukraine, to forge a different path from pursuing
                a career in finance after graduating with honors in economics from Kyiv University. Quadrilingual and
                equally intuitive and inquisitive by nature, the interpersonal is her sense and sensibility. From having
                worked as a photographer, journalist, and art director in different countries, to growing into
                facilitating psychoactive dance and sexuality related encounters Tetiana is nowadays engaged in
                conjunction with enthogenica...
                <br><br>
                Introduced to psychoactive compounds in South America that then led to the co-creation of the house of
                synergies, Tetiana relates to one another as the meeting ground of trust and vulnerability, openness and
                fluidity rather than as a means to an
                end. Vocal as visceral, this is the way Tetiana bridges the erotic to the exoteric, the personal to the
                transpersonal and the intimate to the invaluable in the here and now. Straightforward, she is an
                instigator and catalyst as Tetiana balances support and challenge no differently. In her own words: “It
                is said that all answers lay within. But do we inquire?”...
                <br><br>
                Inquiry has led Tetiana come to see that not all answers lay within and that going by what is said, she
                keeps herself as bound to go round-and-round in the same downtrodden circles as the bygone has it:
                magic, myth and meaning. To be alive is for
                Tetiana a continuous unveiling and transformation rather than an endless self- improvement...
